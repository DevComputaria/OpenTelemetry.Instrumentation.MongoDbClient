# Commit Message Instructions

- Be extremely detailed with the file changes and the reason for the change.
- Follow the Conventional Commits specification:
  - **feat**: A new feature
  - **fix**: A bug fix
  - **docs**: Documentation only changes
  - **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - **perf**: A code change that improves performance
  - **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
  - **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- Include a scope when relevant (e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`).
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., `fix bug` instead of `fixed bug` or `fixes bug`).
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
